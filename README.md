# Javascrip Calander
It was my own project learning JS. During this project my knowledge was bigger and bigger therefore this is why we have var, const and let.
When I started creating this my knowledge was basic and it was not close to being in ES6. As i was finishing the frontend I started to grasp the knowledge of let and const.
